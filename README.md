PROJECT ODIN RECIPES 
Am Erick Wambugu and am currently taking part in The Odin Project 
My love for laptops and machiines has landed me to the interest of learning how to code especially Web Development 
I stated this course as an absolute beginner with no prior knowledge and am current at the Odi Recipes Project 

I have so far learnt and gained knowledge and skills on 
        1. What is the internet, website, network and how they all work
        2. Introduction and the basic operation of Git and GitHub;
            That is from creating a repository to clonning, creating files and commiting them back to the repository 
        3. HTML - Hyper Markup Language which is the backborne of every website as i have come to understand
I hope to use every arsenal in my skill set learnt in this mini-project on recipes:
    Creating a repository, clonning it in my machine, creating files (HTML) and writting codes in them using the boilerplate to commiting them back to the repository. 
    I hope to expand and increase my knowledge with this project as it will be a good stepping stone into a huge skill, career field am diving into.
