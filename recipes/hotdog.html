    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 (1-ounce) slices white bread (such as Wonder Bread)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons yellow mustard</li>
            <li>4 thin slices sharp Cheddar cheese, halved</li>
            <li>8 beef hot dogs (such as Oscar Mayer Classic Wieners Hot Dogs)</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons minced yellow onion</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons plus 2 tablespoons  sweet pickle relish</li>
            <li>1/4 cup barbecue sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt (such as Lawry's)</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
            <p>Gther all Ingredients</p>
            <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
            <p>Using a rolling pin, roll each bread slice until entirely flat. Trimjust the crust each bread slice, forming a 4*4-inch square. Spread each bread slice with an even layer of mustard (about 3/4 teaspoon per slice)</p>
            <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
            <p>Working with 1 slice of bread at a time, place a halved cheese slice on the edge of the bread closest to you; place 1 hot dog horizontally on top of the cheese slice. If needed, trim the ends of the hot dog so that no hot dog extends over the edges of bread. Spoon 1 1/2 tablespoons onion horizontally across the cheese slice above the hot dog, followed by 1 teaspoon of relish.</p>
            <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>
            <p>Roll up tightly, applying gentle pressure to help seal the bread seams together. Slice crosswise into 3 equal pieces (about 1 1/4-inches each), and transfer to a serving platter. Repeat process with remaining ingredients. Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 5 minutes, or according to manufacturer's instructions. Lightly coat tops and sides of roll-ups with cooking spray. Working in 2 batches, add roll-ups to basket, spacing them 1/2-inch apart, and cook until bread is lightly golden brown, about 5 minutes.</p>

            <p>Stir together barbecue sauce, mayonnaise, and seasoned salt in a small bowl until even combined.</p>

            <p>Serve hotdog roll-ups with mayonnaise mixture.</p>
